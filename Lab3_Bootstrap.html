            It's one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. ... JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn</div>

            <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3><br>
            Key differences between Java and JavaScript: Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.</div>

            In this will be able to learn to print 'Hello World' in JavaScript in three different ways.

            A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners</div>

            <h3>Variables</h3><br>
            A variable in Mathematics is defined as the alphabetic character that expresses a numerical value or a number. In algebraic equations, a variable is used to represent an unknown quantity.
            These variables can be any alphabets from a to z. Most commonly, ‘a’,’b’,’c’, ‘x’,’y’ and ‘z’ are used as variables in equations.
            Making arithmetical calculations with variables as though they were express numbers permits one to take care of scope of issues in a solitary calculation.

            <h3> Declaring Variables</h3><br>
            A declaration of a variable is where a program says that it needs a variable. For our small programs, place declaration statements between the two braces of the main method. The declaration gives a name and a data type for the variable. It may also ask that a particular value be placed in the variable.

            <h3> Variable Scope</h3><br>
            what is the scope of a variable? The scope of a variable can be defined as the accessibility of a variable in the program. It means whenever a variable is defined in a program, it is not accessible in every portion of it. It might be accessed in some portion or in all portion of it. Another name for scope is visibility. So scope of a variable is actually the part of a program where it is visible. For better understanding the concept, lets consider two cases.
